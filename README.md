# Introduction 
Youtube Gameplay Video , only been able to record for VR and Android/IOS. Hololens video gameplay coming soon : https://youtu.be/ycfLXDMauZ0
This is a project that I had to work on during a 3-month internship. 
An Air Hockey XR game . Meaning that the game can be played on Android , IOS devices as well as Hololens 2 , Hololens 1 , Oculus Quest 2 and many more XR Devices

You can play against a dummy AI for now. A Smarter and a more unpredictible AI is to be implemented in the future. 
All assets present in the game (except one) are modeled by me. 

SDKs used : XR Interaction Toolkit, ARFoundation, ARKit, ARCore,  OpenXR, MRTK3 from Microsoft . Tried Oculus Integration but went back to OpenXR for compatible platforms extensibility

With the help of mentors and insightful advices from people I worked with during the internship, I managed to have very clean, decoupled code, using design patterns such as Composition, Singletons for managers, etc

Multiplayer functionality coming soon using Photon Fusion (I hope) 

Will provide APK's and executable packages in the future for installing and trying the game on different plaforms
